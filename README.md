</h1>

This application is built mainly using Python. The user can choose from the dropdown menu which sorting algorithm to use as well as how visualization occurs.

## Problem Statement

I built this application in order to have an easier and deeper understanding of the most important sorting algorithms using Python and Tkinter library. The application can help beginners to visualize the flow of different sorting algorithms and trace the changes occurring in the position of elements of the array.

## Programming Language And Tools

This project uses a python standard GUI library 'Tkinter'. The Tkinter module helps in
creating GUI applications in a fast and easy way.
Some common ones are Buttons, Labels, Frames, Menus, Scrollbar, and so on.
Some of the advantages of using Tkinter include -
Tkinter provides three geometry managers: place, pack, and grid. That is much
more powerful and easy to use.
Tkinter is more flexible and stable.
It has standard attributed dimensions, fonts, colors, cursors, anchors, and bitmaps
for a better GUI.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented:

1. Insertion Sort
2. Bubble Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Counting Sort
6. Merge Sort

## Run

To run this application execute `GUI.py`. The only dependency is `Tkinter`.
